Power BI	Dashboard creation & interactive visuals
Gamma App	Automated presentation generation
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code	Development environment
✅ Project Steps

Data Loading (Python)

Loaded CSV into Pandas

Checked data types, missing values, and structure

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used Pandas visualization

Identified trends, outliers, and patterns

Data Cleaning

Handled null values, duplicates, and data type conversions

Normalized data and prepared for SQL import

SQL Querying (MySQL)

Imported cleaned data into MySQL

Wrote queries to segment, filter, and aggregate data

Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to MySQL

Created interactive visuals (KPIs, charts, tables)

Report & PPT Creation

Summarized insights in a written report

Used Gamma.app to generate a clean, visual presentation

📊 Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

e.g., "Product X contributes 40% of revenue"

e.g., "Customer churn is highest in Region Y"

These insights were used to suggest strategic actions such as [brief business recommendations].

Steps:
Run Python Scripts

Open eda_cleaning.ipynb for data loading, EDA, and cleaning.

Import Data to MySQL

Use cleaned_data.csv

SQL queries are saved in queries.sql

Open Power BI File

Load dashboard.pbix to explore the dashboard.

Review Report

Open report.pdf or report.md for a summary of findings.
